# SIEM-System

## Objective

During my time as an IT Intern with Bellevue College I was responsible for developing and deploying a SIEM system to monitor and analyze security threats on user endpoint devices. This system was required to be deployed in an on-premises environment, be scalable, and be flexible. To ensure that all requirements were met I had decided to host the SIEM system locally on a Raspberry Pi. I chose to configure the SIEM using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana). Using the ELK Stack to power a SIEM on a Raspberry Pi provided a cost-effective and versatile solution for on-premises log analysis and security monitoring. It was a system capable of ingesting, processing, and visualizing security data from multiple endpoints.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM/SOAR concepts and practical application within the ELK Stack environment.
- Proficiency in setting up and configuring Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for log management and analysis.
- Skill in generating and recognizing attack signatures and patterns within ELK.
- Practice in designing and creating visualizations in Kibana for effective data analysis and monitoring.
- Strengthened critical thinking and problem-solving skills within cybersecurity contexts.

### Tools Used

- Elasticstack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) was the primary SIEM tool used for log ingestion and analysis.
- Raspberry Pi 4 was utilized as my local server for an on-premises deployment.
- Ubuntu Server 24.04 was the primary operating system which the SIEM system was configured.
